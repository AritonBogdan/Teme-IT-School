1.What is casting in Java?
In Java, casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. 
This is particularly useful when you want to assign a value of one type to a variable of another type, or when you need 
to perform operations that involve different data types.


2.What is memory reference?
        A memory reference in computer science refers to a way of accessing data stored in memory. 
 It typically involves obtaining the address of a particular memory location where the data is stored.
 This address serves as a reference or pointer to the location of the data in memory.

3.What are decision constructs in Java? If, else?

Decision constructs in Java are programming structures that allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. 
The most common decision constructs in Java are the if, else if, and else statements.

IF statement: The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
 If the condition is false, the code block associated with the if statement is skipped.

ELSE IF statement: The else if statement allows you to specify additional conditions to be tested if the preceding
 if statement's condition is false. It can be used multiple times to test multiple conditions sequentially.

ELSE statement: The else statement is used to execute a block of code if none of the preceding conditions in the if and
 else if statements are true. It does not have a condition associated with it and is typically used as a fallback option.
